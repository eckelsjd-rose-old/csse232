# This file contains a MIPS assembly language program that uses only the
# instructions introduced in p1.asm plus the following:
#
#   lui rdest, imm	- Loads the immediate imm into the upper 16-bits
#			  of register rt.  The lower bits of the register
#			  are set to 0.
#   li rdest, imm	- Moves the immediate imm into register rdest.
#			  This pseudoinstruction actually translates into
#			  lui and ori.
#
# It demonstrates the behavior of the lui instruction and the expansion
# of the li instruction
#
# It is intended to help CSSE 232 students familiarize themselves with MIPS.

	.globl main			# Make MAIN globl so you can refer to it by name.

	.text				# Text section of the program (as opposed to data).

main:					# Program starts at main.
	ori	$t2, $0, 40		# Register $t2 gets 40
	lui	$t2, 0x1234		# Upper half of register $t2 gets 0x1234
	ori	$t2, $t2, 40		# Lower half of register $t2 gets 40

	li	 $t3, 0x12340028	# Register $t3 gets 0x12340028

	li	 $v0, 10		# Prepare to exit
	syscall				#   ... Exit.
