Milestone 1

MEETING 1.0 - 01/07/2019 - 12:40 pm [60 min]
Members Present: Alex, Josh, Bailey
	(Eric not present due to miscommunication on members present's parts)

We decided to use a load/store architecture to build our processor. Part of the reason was it would be the easiest architecture to use in order to have 16-bit immediates. We could also use an accumulator style for math instructions using a dedicated register. 

MEETING 1.1 - 01/08/2019 - 2:30 pm [50 min]
All members present & on time

Discussed how to construct instructions (ie how to divide bits to opcodes, regs, etc), registers. Decided that we would use more registers in favor of speed as opposed to using the stack. To account for this, we would have 128 function registers that would be represented by the first 16 "f" regs that could be all accessed by using (FCC * 16) + regs. 


MEETING 1.2 - 01/08/2019 - 8:30 pm [90 min]
All members present

Began working on translating Euclid's Algorithm, relPrime, and other small algorithms to demonstrate operations. Also translated our instructions to machine code. 

MEETING 1.3 - 01/09/2019 - 1:30 pm [120 min]
All members present

Finished Euclid's algorithm and relPrime. Translated the assembly language snippets to machine code. Polished the document. Completed Milestone 1. Pushed everything to git log in Design branch.

Milestone 2 

MEETING 2.0 - 01/14/2019 - 5:10 pm [60 min]
Members Present: Josh, Bailey, Eric 
Put the skeleton of the RTL in the table and mapped out what kind of registers we need for our RTL and what they do 

MEETING 2.1 - 01/15/2019 - 5:30 pm [90 min]
All members present 
Finished the RTL write-up for all instructions. Polished them. 
Recorded a list of components that will be needed for the data path. 
NOTE: REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "MOV" INSTR!!!

MEETING 2.2 - 01/16/2019 - 1:30pm [120 min]
All members present
Polished up and translate RTL over to our design document. Developed shopping list for all hardware in our RTL.
Started describing our components. Added a comparator to the list, ALU now has 3 bit opcodes as we had 5 operations and needed 3 control wires to accomodate this. 
Developed a "code-tracing thought experiment" in order to test our RTL, easier and quicker to develop than a simluation and less reliant on others than a survery from other groups.

Milestone 3

MEETING 3.1 - 01/20/2019 - 2:30pm [150 min]
All members present (Alex facetime)
Completed rough draft of datapath after walking through RTL for each instruction. Made changes to RTL based on our datapath.
We are still in need of documentation for each component and subsystem. Worked on defining and documenting control signals.
Will use a ROM for control unit. Meeting tomorrow to move a lot of the work from today into the design document.

MEETING 3.2 - 01/21/2019 - 5:10pm [120 min]: 
All members present
Defining and describing every control signal. Working on ways to perform unit and integration testing on
our datapath. Started looking at Verilog and how to implement some components. Working on documention on Design document.

MEETING 3.3 - 01/22/2019 - 7:00pm [310 min]: 
Updated datapath to reflect control unit, subsystems, and integration plan. Wrote/planned all unit and integrations tests. Wrote verilog modules and test benches for comparator, adder, and mux.
Updated list of hardware components, and reformatted into tables. Updated RTL, including plan for a simulation to verify RTL. Updated design document.

Milestone 4

MEETING 4.1 - 01/27/2019 - 6:00 pm [180 min]:
Members present: Bailey, Alex, Eric
Completed the finite state machine for the datapath control signals. Described different
testing methods for the finite state machine.

MEETING 4.2 - 01/28/2019 - 6:00 pm [300 min]:
All members present
Implemented most of the components in VHDL, except for memory, which still has some
reading problems. Planned to meet tomorrow to write up integration plans.

MEETING 4.3 - 01/30/2019 - 3:00 pm [300 min]:
All members present
Finished implementing register file and memory unit, along with their unit tests. Implemented some integration between the components
and finalized the multicycle FSM.

Milestone 5

MEETING 5.1 - 02/03/1029 - 1:00 pm [90 min]:
All members present
Formulated and discussed our plans for the week. Discussed a few issues with the data path that needed to be fixed and what solutions we
wanted to go with. Divided integration work up and assign parts to everyone to have done by Wednesday. Alex whooped Eric in smash.

MEETING 5.2 - 02/04/2019 - 10:50 pm [50 min]
Members present: Josh, Alex
Created base code for the control unit.

MEETING 5.3 - 02/05/2019 - 6:00 pm [150 min]:
Members present: Josh (60 min), Alex, Bailey, Eric (late)
Worked on integrating our systems. Control unit finished along with PMS and ALS. Still need FBS and RMS. Updated the design document
to reflect changes. Base code for the F Register Backup System has been created.

MEETING 5.4 - 02/06/2019 - 7:00 pm [60 min]:
All members present. 
F Register Backup System has been tested. Realized there were some clock timing issues
that had to be noted whene using the system.
ALU System has been successfully implemented.

MEETING 5.5 - 02/07/2019 - 10:00 pm [180 minutes]
All members present
ALU System has been tested.
The Register Management System has been implemented. Fixed some bugs that
were in the original control unit and updated the design document accordingly

MEETING 5.6 - 02/08/2019 - 7:00 pm [180 minutes]
All members present
The Instruction Execution System and datapath has been implemented. The Instruction
Execution System is also tested.

MEETING 5.7 - 02/10/2019 - 4:00 pm [240 minutes]
All members present
The datapath has been tested and the design document has been updated
according to the changes from the current milestone. Updates to the team journal and
individual journals were made.
