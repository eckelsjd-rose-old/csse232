Monday, January 7, 2019 [20 min]: 
Discussed implementation strategy for the BAEJ Assembly Language.

Tuesday, January 8, 2019 [50 min (1), 200 min (2)]: 
Implementing modulus using BAEJ and helped with the summation function. 
When challenges arose, I discussed certain implementations that were needed to satisfy
the requirements for the functions.
Began work on implementing Euclid's algorithm in our language.

Wednesday, January 9, 2019 [120 min]: 
Finishing translation of relPrime into BAEJ and machine language. Reformatting document.

01/14/2019 - 5:10 pm [60 min]
Helped write the skeleton of the RTL table.

01/15/2019 - 5:30 pm [90 min]
 
Helped finish the RTL write-up for all instructions. Reviewed the instructions. 

01/16/2019 - 1:30pm [120 min]
Wrote out the hardware component spec for the ALU. Reformated and reviewed the document.

01/20/2019 - 2:30pm [150 min]
Helped draw up a rough draft of datapath via RTL.
Discussed implementation method of backing of registers.

01/21/2019 - 5:10pm [120 min]: 
Wrote up a rough draft of component unit testing methods.

01/22/2019 - 7:00 pm [270 min]:
Drew up and named subsystems for integration testing. Peer reviewed.
Rewrote methods of testing the RTL.

**Milestone 4**
01/27/2019 - 6:00 pm [180 min]:
Drafted the finite state machine for the datapath control signals. Described different
testing methods for the finite state machine with Alex.

01/28/2019 - 6:00 pm [240 min]:
Implemented the memory unit. Memory unit test still has bugs.

01/30/2019 - 3:00 pm [300 min]:
Finished implementing memory unit, along with its unit tests.

**Milestone 5**

02/03/2019 - 1:00 pm [90 min]:
Discussed the plans for the rest of the week. Communicated an issue about ra being lost
upon nested function calls.

02/04/2019 - 8:00 pm [120 min]:
Worked on integrating and testing the F Register Backup System. Discovered that there
were errors with the testbench and not the module itself.

02/05/2019 - 9:00 pm [120 min]:
Worked on integrating and testing the F Register Backup System. Bailey helped
debug the test cases and found out that it was a timing issue. The FBS has been finalized.

02/06/2019 - 11:00 pm [150 min]:
Helped Josh debug the ALUS. Updated documentation and started the presentation powerpoint.

02/07/2019 - 8:00 pm [60 min]:
Helped Josh and Bailey debug the Register Management System.

02/08/2019 - 7:00 pm [60 min]:
Helped debug the datapath and discussed methods of I/O.

02/10/2019 - 4:00 pm [240 min]:
Updated the team journal and updated design document according to the current milestone
with Josh.
