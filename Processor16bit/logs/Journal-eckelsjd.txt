Monday, January 7, 2019 [50 min]: Decisions on architecture type. Load-store with accumulators considered.
			Listing necessary functions to implement.

Tuesday, January 8, 2019 [50 min (1), 90 min (2)]: Assigning registers (Function regs, args, etc.). 2 instruction types (G and I).
			Began work on implementing Euclid's algorithm in our language. Worked on desgin document.

Wednesday, January 9, 2019 [120 min]: Finishing translation of relPrime into BAEJ and machine language. Reformatting document.

Monday, January 14, 2019 [60 min]: Working on RTL for milestone 2. Dividing up instructions into multiple cycles. Excel document made for RTL.

Tuesday, January 15, 2019 [90 min]: Finished RTL table, discussed shopping list and control signals

Wednesday, January 16, 2019 [120 min]: Finished M2, discussion of each item in shopping list, method for verifying our RTL.
					Wrote up description for all of the registers we used in our RTL.

Sunday, January 20, 2019 [150 min]: Working on M3. Walked through RTL and drew datapath on whiteboard appropriately. Just a rough draft.
                                    Needs a lot of work tomorrow. Still need to document all of our changes and new updates.

Monday, January 21, 2019 [150 min]: Working on control signals, bit sizes, purposes, and functionality in our datapath. Writing this up
                                    in the Design document as a table with complete list and description of all control signals.

Tuesday, January 22, 2019 [250 min]: Fixing formatting of hardware components in design document. Learning verilog. Created verilog modules for
                                     16-bit adder, 1-bit mux, and comparator (including test benches for each).

Monday, January 28, 2019 [330 min]: Finished implementations and extensive test benches on 1-bit mux, 2-bit mux, adder, and ALU.
				    ALU still has some bugs in it. Need to do regs as well.

Wednesday, January 30, 2019 [60 min]: ALU bugs fixed. Decided we don't need actual reg hardware; they can just be instantiated whenever we need them.

Sunday, February 3, 2019 [60 min]: Discussed rest of project. Divided up work. Began on control unit. Will begin working on ALU sub-system for integration plan.

Monday, February 4, 2019 [90 min]: Worked with Alex. Finished control unit and test bench. Noticed a lot of inconsistencies in naming conventions.

Tuesday, February 5, 2019 [50 min]: Realized issues with control unit. Needs to be implemented as finite state machine.

Wednesday, February 6, 2019 [200 min]: Multicycle control unit finished. Test bench completed and extensive. Working on Arithmetic logic implementation system.

Wednesday, February 6, 2019 [120 min]: Meeting number 2 today. Finished ALS integration system with extensive testing. Unclocked ALU (causing a cycle delay).

Thursday, February 7, 2019 [180 min]: Massive bug fix in the register management system. Comparator was broken lol. Will finish tomorrow.

Friday, February 8, 2019 [120 min]: Register management system is 100% functional with extensive testing. Had to fix bugs in the comparator and the reg file.

Saturday, February 9, 2019 [60 min]: Testing relPrime on our processor. Lot of debugging. Realizing more issues with control unit.

Sunday, February 10, 2019 [120 min]: Scanning through and updating design document with work over the past couple weeks. Control unit was updated and is working.
				     Also was having more issues with RA that needed to be fixed with restoring and backing up. Updated FSM and RTL.

Tuesday, February 12, 2019 [100 min]: Added code to have program pauses after finishing execution. Memory can now read programs from a .mem file. Synthesis works. 
				      Working on benchmarking.

Friday, February 15, 2019 [60 min]: Demo day. Working on a template for final report. Writing a few more quick test programs.
